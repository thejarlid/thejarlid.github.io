        <h2>April 20th, 2020</h2>
        <p>I’ve often had conversations with my friends about shows we’ve grown up with. Shows that for years we’ve dedicated evenings to binging, rewatching, and humming along to the nostalgic theme songs. For myself, The Office is gravitational as if it yearns to be played and sat through either for chuckles or mindless passiveness. It’s a show for all seasons and moods, I’ll admit to even having watched it while doing homework to create an ambience of having other people around. I’ve probably watched it completely through about 9 times, but while I’ve grown up with the show, I’ve not necessarily grown with the show. It’s a nuance that I came to realize while watching the final season of Silicon Valley; it&#39;s the only show for which I can parallel my personal growth alongside the show’s story arc. With the purpose of satire being to hold up a mirror on its subject, Silicon Valley, for the past 6 years, has provided a humorous and often brutally honest reflection on myself and the evolution of the tech industry since the first episode aired. </p>
        <p>When the show premiered in 2014, I was still a junior in High School (surprisingly more awkward than I am now), Apple had just released iOS 7 which would change the trajectory of UI design for the years to come, Satya Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft, and the ice bucket challenge was viral. It was a far different time and back then I would still consider myself an outsider fo the tech industry, just a kid peering wide-eyed over the fence into the “Garden of Tech Eden” as Erlich would say. It was a time where the companies and products inspired the world with their creativity and what they enabled us to do. From the other side of the fence hearing stories of startups and their meteoric rise gave way to a new kind of American dream, one that anyone with a laptop and idea could code their way towards. This was the exact essence of the show, Richard and his friends going off to build Pied Piper with limited resources and the odds stacked against them.</p>
        <p>At the same time I had just learned how to write “Hello world” and myself and my best friend, Isaiah, spent our evenings and weekends trying to create our own app development startup. Our vision was quite juvenile, we were just two lads having fun making apps and thriving on the feeling that we were on the cusp of building something great. We imagined that at the end of the journey we would have worked our way to the other side of the fence. It wasn’t necessarily in our expectations to become millionaires or the next big startup, but instead that we would be part of visionaries building the new world. </p>
        <p>Silicon Valley and more generally the developer community was a fun place where people had a love for solving problems, stressing their mind to find innovative ways to improve upon existing theorems and algorithms, and finding new applications of the technology. It was where like-minded individuals felt welcomed; a paradise for nerdy passion. Among everything it was clear to see that there was a genuine belief that developers and CEOs wanted to improve the world and have fun while doing it. It’s funny and somewhat cringe to look back on and I believe that’s what the show’s comedic genius captured. The reality of Silicon Valley was a balancing act of excitement and absurdity. It was a microcosm of excessiveness, interesting characters, offices that were more like playgrounds, and the lines between work and play were often blurred. The mix of craziness and brilliance in the real world made it perfect to make fun of. Watching each episode felt more akin to a roast that is just more enjoyable once you lean into it and embrace it. </p>
        <p><img class="large" src="https://i.imgur.com/G7Cs9Wc.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>This was back before I had any real formal Computer Science education, I was unaware of the theoretical foundations of the field, the various specialisations, or more importantly the impact I had on society. I, and more so the tech industry the show depicted, was innocent. This allowed the gravity of the jokes to hold nothing more than chuckles you could brush aside once over. But in the years since 2014, the world changed forcing the show’s later seasons to adjust its narrative to stay grounded in reality. </p>
        <p>By 2016 I was a freshman at University, I was working two jobs, enjoying the classes I was taking, making new friends, and simply becoming more independent. This was all soon matched by a bleak political and social atmosphere. With Trump winning the presidency and the spread of hate crime across the United States, the curtains were pulled back on the ugliness that was hiding in society. In particular, a spotlight fell on Silicon Valley exposing some dark secrets and scandals. Among the most prominent was the abuse of Facebook’s data by Cambridge Analytica, the Russian meddling and fake news. However, it was far beyond just one company, Uber’s self-driving car killed a person, Theranos’ lies unravelled, Apple went head to head with the FBI over protecting the security of its user’s by refusing to unlock a phone, in addition to the countless data breaches and other news headlines. The products people used started to become less of a mystery, more people started to understand how companies like Google and Facebook made money, how companies track them, and how their data is collected. The sentiment behind “OMG look at what they can do” which was once exclaimed in awe and excitement shifted to that of fear.</p>
        <p>The industry took heat and there was a great deal of hostility that many in tech, including myself, faced. Between my family and my friends, I was the only Computer Science major and who could be considered “in the industry”. As such I found myself having to answer countless questions about how I personally felt about a tech company having done something that made the headlines, whether I believed it was right or wrong, and answering technical questions which don’t have a simple answer for anyone not familiar with a lot of prior information. I found myself having to represent the world of tech and listen to the concerns of many people I cared about. I didn’t ask for and neither did I foresee that I would have to take this responsibility when I decided to study CS. I went into the field because I have a genuine love for solving problems and I find all the complexity that exists behind our seamlessly connected world interesting. But it became a new role I had to grow into. </p>
        <p>Much like the topics in the show throughout the later seasons, the stakes became higher and there was an increase in companies having to answer for their actions; Hooli acquiring HooliChat’s data that had data for underage children, the game company collecting user data, and ultimately Pied Piper succeeding so well that they would destroy the state of internet security. Back when Facebook’s motto was “Move Fast and Break Things” the show thrived under recklessness as did the fictional companies, but once things did break and society faced massive repercussions it didn’t seem as funny to joke about. The dark tone of society was mirrored in the show and there was a real weight being carried in the satirical elements all while still trying to maintain the comedic appeal.</p>
        <p><img class="medium" src="https://i.imgur.com/EHktrwV.jpg" alt=""></p>
        <p>The world evolved, the show matured, real tech giants matured, and I matured. I slowly began to realize that while I can enjoy my love of CS the responsibility of what I build comes with it. I should add that I don’t believe that companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft had ill intentions or wished to cause harm in any of the mishaps that they may have had a part in. I believe they were simply doing what they thought was exciting and helpful. Like mistakes we make in our own lives, there’s a way to learn from them and move forward. Companies have taken measures to prevent this in the future, transparency between the company and the public has increased, and they have set out to do what they intended; to make the world a better place. Pied Piper on the show illustrated this perfectly with their success being at the cost of ending encryption. The company held true to their morals and failed publicly to prevent the exposure of this technology. It was in a sense lying to the world for the greater good. Following the laughter of the final episode, I sat there with a feeling of inspiration again as if there is a redemption for us to do good.</p>
        <p>I was left thinking about the show long after the finale and I texted Isaiah about it. In the years since we started watching the show together, we largely went down different paths. We ended reminiscing and reflecting on the past 9 years we’d been best friends and ultimately it led to me write this piece. By the closing of the show this dorky wide-eyed kid was finally on the other side of the fence and now with the work I do, professionally and in my free time, there’s room to build things that matter and in a way that not only inspires but has a purpose.</p>
