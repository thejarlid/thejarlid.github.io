  description: "My quarantine side-project when covid began was to productize the todo list I had built for myself during college. I designed, implmented, and released Meraki which is a simple and minimalist todo list that aims to inspire a mindful and relaxed approach to user's tasks. Developed for iOS first, following the release I'm working to make this a cross platform experience."

  description: "Following my attempt at developing a rudimentary video stabilizer for my Computer Vision course's final project I wanted to explore industry approaches. Looking into the topic I found a research paper by Google titled Auto Directed Video Stabilization with Robust L1 Optimal Camera Paths. This is my implementation of methods presented in the paper. To read more about this I have also written a blog post on it."

  description: "This is my implementation of the xv6 POSIX-like kernel from CSE 451 OS - Fall 2017. xv6 is a modern reimplementation of Sixth Edition Unix. This was the first time this project (titled xk in the course material). This project sparked my love for operating systems and working at the systems level. I later went on to TA the course and build up support and infrastructure for this codebase."

  description: "This is the first large scale project I ever undertook. Having never programmed before I wanted to build an iOS app so with my best friend in high school we both create Citrus which went on to eventually become featured on the Apple App Store as Best New App in Germany, Sweden, and Austria. This was my first exposure to iOS development and sparked my love for the development ecosystem."
