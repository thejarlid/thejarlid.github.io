I designed, implmented, and released Meraki which is a simple and minimalist todo list that aims to inspire a mindful and relaxed approach to user's tasks. Developed for iOS first, following the release I'm working to make this a cross platform experience.","name":"Meraki","link":"https://merakiapp.co","date":"2020 - Current","imgSrc":"thumbnail_meraki.png"}},{"node":{"id":"474433d2-b9ca-5070-9e29-8b9e31a0ddf2","description":"I'm currently a software engineer on the HoloLens Systems, sensors, and firmware team at Microsoft.

Looking into the topic I found a research paper by Google titled Auto Directed Video Stabilization with Robust L1 Optimal Camera Paths. This is my implementation of methods presented in the paper. To read more about this I have also written a blog post on it.","name":"L1 Auto Directed Video Stabilization","link":"https://github.com/thejarlid/VideoStabilizationPy","date":"2020","imgSrc":"thumbnail_videoStabilization.png"}},{"node":{"id":"6ec3dc06-7cfa-5cea-84d2-a2c2dd7a3ec7","description":"A basic Image Library and Video Stabilization Tool in C++ containing low level image processing pipelines for applying filters, Harris corner detection, panorama stitching, and optical flow.
